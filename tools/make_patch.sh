# Nobody has to supply the base ROM: pret's decompilation rebuilds it bit for
# bit, and the result is checked against the SHA-1 pret and No-Intro publish
# before anything is created from it. The patch is then applied back to that
# base and compared with the ROM, so a patch that would not reproduce the
# build is never written out.
#
# BPS, not IPS: IPS offsets are 24-bit and stop at 16 MiB, Hasep is 32 MiB.
#
# Needs the same toolchain as `make hns` plus g++. Everything it fetches is
# pinned below and cached in $PATCH_CACHE, so later runs only rebuild Flips
# when it is missing and never rebuild Emerald.
